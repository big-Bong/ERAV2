Each folder corresponds to a different session. This will be the root folder for the entire course.

## Session 5 (PyTorch)

Session 5 contains the following files:
> S5.ipynb: This is the main file from which the code will get executed. This is designed like a Jupyter/Google Colab notebook
> models.py: This contains the actual neural network architecture
> utils.py: Contains all utility functions related to training and testing the model. Getting the summary of the model, and transforming the data
